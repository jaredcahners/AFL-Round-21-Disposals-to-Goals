# AFL-Round-21-Disposals-to-Goals
Through AFL round 21, whose disposals lead to the most points? Which players contribute to most of their team's goals?

## Description
Using play-by-play data through round 21 provided by Richard Little (https://github.com/alittlefitness/afl_play_by_play), I used pandas to determine, for those players who had at least 400 disposals so far, when they had a disposal, that possession resulted in how many points on average. And then I looked at all the possessions every team had that led to goals, and I determined which payers were involved (had a disposal) in the highest percentage of their teams goals.
